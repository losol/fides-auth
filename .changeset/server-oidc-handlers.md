"@eventuras/fides-auth-next": patch
---

Move the OIDC request handlers — `handleOidcLogin`, `handleOidcCallback`, `handleHeartbeat` — into `@eventuras/fides-auth/server`, taking a `CookieStore` and an optional rate-limit callback over the standard Request/Response. `fides-auth-next` now wraps them with its Next cookie store and rate limiters; public API unchanged.
