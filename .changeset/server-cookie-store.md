"@eventuras/fides-auth-next": patch
---

Add a framework-agnostic `CookieStore` interface and session persistence helpers (`persistSession`, `readSession`, `refreshSessionInStore`, `clearSession`) at `@eventuras/fides-auth/server`. `fides-auth-next`'s session functions now delegate to them through a Next cookie-store adapter; public API unchanged.
